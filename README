Nested relations  Hack
#################################################

This plugin hack the 'condition_from_association_constraint' method initialy defined in active_scaffold/lib/active_scaffold/constraints.rb

The ActiveScaffold neested links only worked in one direction for the 'has_many-belongs_to' and 'has_one-belongs_to' relations.

This hack now solve the problem.

Take a look at the active_scaffold_hacks/lib/active_scaffold/constraints.rb file for more informations.

-----
There is also a hack that fix the polymorphic nested relations that ActiveScafold didn't handle correctly.
This issue is fixed in active_scaffold_hacks/lib/extensions/reverse_associations.rb
and in active_scaffold_hacks/frontends/default/views/_nested.html.erb



-----
THere is also a hack that fix the one-model-loop nested relation (when a same model have both the :has_many and :belongs_to relations).
ActiveScaffold didn't handle this case.
The fix is in active_scaffold_hacks/lib/extensions/reverse_associations.rb at the end of the 'reverse_matches_for' method
