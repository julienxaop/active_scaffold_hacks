For the moment this plugin only contain one hack:
#################################################

This hack the 'condition_from_association_constraint' method initialy defined in active_scaffold/lib/active_scaffold/constraints.rb

The ActiveScaffold neested links only worked in one direction for the 'has_many-belongs_to' and 'has_one-belongs_to' relations.

This hack now solve the problem.

Take a look at the active_scaffold_hacks/lib/active_scaffold/constraints.rb file for more informations.
